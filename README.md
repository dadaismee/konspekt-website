# Konspekt

## A project about sustainable academic writing

Research writing can be daunting and complex, and there is a certain lack of defined procedures and workflows that are not overly "techy". To solve this problem, Konspekt promotes an end-to-end writing experience: 

- a video course teaching Zettelkasten and Pandoc manually with your favorite instruements
- a toolchain that does the same automatically and helps to organize the writing process
- a blog & newsletter about tips, tricks and trends in streamlined writing
- meetups of a like-minded community of academics and writers who want to streamline the writing procedures and make them transaparent.
